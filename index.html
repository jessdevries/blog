      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        My goal for this class is to learn to code the right way from the beginning and become a more rounded designer.
        I am interested in learning git and learning how to use version control.

      <h2>Concerns About Learning HTML</h2>
      <p>
        My concern about learning HTML is finding ways to motivate myself to learn more than I already know.
